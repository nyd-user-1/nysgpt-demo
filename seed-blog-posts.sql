  'FY 2027 Financial Plan: A $318.8 Billion Investment in New York''s Future',
  'Governor Hochul''s FY 2027 Executive Budget proposes $318.8 billion in total appropriations, with General Fund spending growing 6.1% to $132.5 billion. Education leads with a $1.53 billion increase to $49.7 billion, while Children and Family Services sees a 16.7% boost.',
  $content$Governor Hochul\u2019s FY 2027 Executive Budget proposes $318.8 billion in total appropriations \u2014 a figure that, despite a modest 0.9% decline from the prior year, reflects a deliberate strategy of disciplined growth in the areas that matter most to New Yorkers. The General Fund, the portion of the budget the state has the most direct control over, grows 6.1% to $132.5 billion, signaling genuine investment even as pandemic-era federal windfalls recede.

## Education Leads the Way

The single largest dollar increase in the FY 2027 budget goes to the State Education Department, which rises $1.53 billion to $49.7 billion. This brings New York\u2019s per-pupil spending commitment to among the highest in the nation and reflects the state\u2019s continued prioritization of K-12 and higher education funding.

The increase isn\u2019t just about maintaining the status quo. It builds on the Foundation Aid formula that was fully funded for the first time in 2023, and it adds resources for English Language Learners, special education, and school safety infrastructure. For districts across the state \u2014 from Buffalo to the Bronx \u2014 this is real money that translates directly into classrooms, teachers, and student services.

## Children, Families, and Social Services

The Office of Children and Family Services sees a 16.7% increase, one of the largest percentage jumps in the budget. This reflects growing state investment in foster care, child protective services, juvenile justice reform, and childcare subsidies \u2014 areas where demand has surged and where underinvestment carries long-term social costs.

The Department of Social Services grows modestly but maintains its essential safety net functions. Medicaid spending through the Department of Health remains the single largest line item at $135.1 billion \u2014 42% of the entire budget \u2014 underscoring that health care is, and will remain, the dominant fiscal reality for New York State.

## Fiscal Discipline in a Post-Pandemic Era

The 0.9% overall decline in total appropriations is itself a sign of discipline. The reduction is driven almost entirely by the Department of Labor, where $8.3 billion in pandemic-era federal unemployment insurance funds are expiring on schedule. This is not a cut \u2014 it\u2019s the planned wind-down of temporary emergency spending.

Strip out the Labor Department, and the rest of the budget is growing. General Fund spending is up 6.1%. State Operations increase to $69.1 billion. The budget adds 441 new Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) across state agencies \u2014 a modest but intentional expansion of state capacity in areas like mental health, environmental enforcement, and regulatory oversight.

## Reserves and Rainy Day Funds

The FY 2027 budget preserves $14.6 billion in principal reserves, maintaining the fiscal cushion the state built during the pandemic-era revenue surge. This is not a budget that spends down its savings. The Rainy Day Fund and other reserve accounts remain at historically high levels, giving Albany a buffer against the next economic downturn or federal funding disruption.

## A Budget That Prioritizes the Fundamentals

The FY 2027 Executive Budget is not a transformative document \u2014 it doesn\u2019t propose sweeping new programs or dramatic structural reforms. What it does is more important in the current fiscal environment: it maintains New York\u2019s core commitments to education, health care, child welfare, and public safety while exercising restraint as temporary federal money disappears.

In a year where many states are facing genuine austerity, New York\u2019s budget delivers a 6.1% General Fund increase, a $1.53 billion education investment, and $14.6 billion in reserves. That\u2019s not austerity \u2014 it\u2019s a state that\u2019s choosing to grow where it matters and save where it can.$content$,

  'The Hidden Risks in the FY 2027 Financial Plan',
  'Behind the topline numbers of the $318.8 billion FY 2027 budget lie structural concerns. The 0.9% overall decline masks a $8.3 billion drop at the Department of Labor as pandemic-era federal funds expire. Aid to Localities decreases 1.7%, and $312.9 billion in reappropriations are carried forward.',
  $content$The FY 2027 Executive Budget\u2019s $318.8 billion topline number sounds reassuring. But a closer reading of the appropriations data reveals structural risks that the headline figures obscure \u2014 risks that legislators should examine carefully before the budget reaches the floor.

## The 0.9% Decline Isn\u2019t What It Seems

The budget\u2019s overall 0.9% decline from the prior year is presented as fiscal restraint. In reality, it\u2019s almost entirely driven by a single line item: the Department of Labor\u2019s $8.3 billion reduction as pandemic-era federal unemployment insurance funds expire. Remove Labor from the equation, and the rest of the budget is growing \u2014 but the growth is uneven in ways that should concern lawmakers.

Aid to Localities \u2014 the category that funds schools, local governments, health care providers, and social services \u2014 actually decreases 1.7%, from $243 billion to $239 billion. This is the money that directly reaches communities across the state, and it\u2019s going down. State Operations, by contrast, grows to $69.1 billion. The budget is asking localities to do more with less while the state\u2019s own administrative apparatus expands.

## The $312.9 Billion Reappropriation Shadow

Perhaps the most striking number in the entire budget isn\u2019t the $318.8 billion in new appropriations \u2014 it\u2019s the $312.9 billion in reappropriations carried forward from prior years. This figure, nearly equal to the entire budget itself, represents spending authority that was authorized in previous fiscal years but never actually spent.

Reappropriations are a normal feature of state budgeting, particularly for multi-year capital projects. But the scale here is extraordinary. The Department of Health alone carries $201 billion in reappropriations \u2014 more than the entire new budget of every other agency combined. This suggests that vast amounts of authorized health spending exist on paper but have never translated into actual services, contracts, or construction.

## Aid to Localities Under Pressure

The 1.7% decline in Aid to Localities is not evenly distributed. While education receives a $1.53 billion increase, other components of local aid are being squeezed. The Department of Labor\u2019s local aid drops by billions as federal pass-through funding disappears. Local assistance for economic development, housing, and transportation faces flat or declining allocations.

For local governments already struggling with rising pension costs, infrastructure needs, and service demands, this shift means the state is effectively transferring fiscal pressure downward. Albany balances its own books while counties, cities, and school districts absorb the strain.

## Debt Service Keeps Climbing

The FY 2027 budget allocates $10.6 billion to debt service \u2014 the cost of borrowing to fund past capital projects. While this represents a modest share of the total budget (3.3%), it\u2019s a number that only moves in one direction. Every new bond issuance adds to this fixed cost, reducing the fiscal space available for discretionary spending in future years.

With $312.9 billion in reappropriations suggesting an enormous pipeline of deferred capital commitments, the state\u2019s future debt service obligations could grow significantly if even a fraction of that authority is eventually drawn down through borrowing.

## Where Are the New FTEs Going?

The budget adds 441 new Full-Time Equivalents across state agencies. While presented as targeted investment in state capacity, the distribution raises questions. Which agencies are getting new staff? Are these front-line service positions or administrative roles? The budget documents provide aggregate numbers but limited transparency on where these positions will be deployed.

In a year where Aid to Localities is declining and local governments are cutting staff, adding hundreds of state employees deserves more explanation than a single line item provides.

## The Bottom Line

The FY 2027 budget is not a crisis document. Reserves remain strong, education is well-funded, and the state\u2019s credit position is solid. But underneath the surface, there are warning signs: a $312.9 billion reappropriation overhang, declining local aid, a post-pandemic federal funding cliff, and rising debt service. These are the structural pressures that don\u2019t make headlines but shape the state\u2019s fiscal trajectory for years to come.

Legislators owe it to their constituents to look past the topline numbers and ask the harder questions about what this budget defers, what it obscures, and what it leaves for future Legislatures to clean up.$content$,

  'Blue Book Analysis: Senate Majority Highlights Smart Investments in Education and Health',
  'The Senate Majority''s Blue Book staff analysis underscores the FY 2027 budget''s commitment to core services. Education receives the single largest dollar increase at $1.53 billion. The Department of Health accounts for 42% of all state spending.',
  $content$Each year the Senate Majority staff produces the \u201CBlue Book\u201D \u2014 an independent analysis of the Governor\u2019s Executive Budget that serves as the Legislature\u2019s own roadmap for budget negotiations. The FY 2027 Blue Book highlights several areas where the Executive Budget aligns with the Senate\u2019s priorities, painting a picture of a budget that, while imperfect, makes meaningful investments in the services New Yorkers depend on most.

## Education: The Largest Single Investment

The Blue Book staff analysis spotlights the $1.53 billion increase to the State Education Department, bringing total education appropriations to $49.7 billion. This is the largest dollar increase of any agency in the budget and represents a continued commitment to the Foundation Aid formula that ensures equitable funding across school districts.

The Senate analysis notes that this increase builds on three consecutive years of record education investment since Foundation Aid was fully funded in 2023. The additional resources target expanding pre-K access, improving special education services, funding English Language Learner programs, and addressing the teacher shortage through recruitment and retention incentives.

For the Senate Majority, education investment is both good policy and good politics. Every Senate district benefits from school aid, and the $1.53 billion increase gives members a tangible accomplishment to bring back to their communities.

## Health Care: 42% of the Budget for a Reason

The Department of Health\u2019s $135.1 billion allocation \u2014 42% of all state spending \u2014 dominates the budget landscape, and the Blue Book treats this as both a strength and a structural reality. New York\u2019s Medicaid program is the largest in the nation, covering over 7 million residents, and the state\u2019s commitment to comprehensive health coverage drives much of this spending.

The Senate staff highlights the $1.01 billion in new capital appropriations for health care system improvement, signaling investment in hospital infrastructure, community health centers, and health IT modernization. The Blue Book also notes the $95 million in HCRA (Health Care Reform Act) capital funding, which supports safety-net hospitals across the state.

## General State Charges: Keeping Promises to Workers

One area the Blue Book treats favorably is the $915 million increase in General State Charges, which covers pension contributions, employee health benefits, and other workforce obligations. While this is often dismissed as \u201Cmandatory spending,\u201D the Senate analysis frames it as the state honoring its commitments to current and retired public employees.

The increase reflects rising pension contribution rates and growing health care costs for the state workforce. The Blue Book notes that underfunding these obligations \u2014 as some states have done \u2014 only defers costs and creates larger fiscal problems down the road. New York\u2019s willingness to absorb these increases now is presented as responsible fiscal management.

## SUNY and CUNY: Sustained Higher Education Investment

The Blue Book highlights SUNY\u2019s $13.4 billion allocation and CUNY\u2019s $5.2 billion as evidence of the state\u2019s commitment to public higher education. Combined, the two university systems receive $18.6 billion \u2014 nearly 6% of the total budget.

The Senate analysis notes that SUNY\u2019s $1.24 billion in new capital appropriations will address deferred maintenance across 64 campuses, while CUNY\u2019s $421 million in capital supports infrastructure improvements at a system that serves over 240,000 students, predominantly from working-class and immigrant families.

## Mental Health and Addiction Services

The Blue Book gives particular attention to the $344 million increase at the Office of Mental Health (5.7% growth) and continued investment in the Office of Addiction Services and Supports. The Senate Majority has made mental health a legislative priority, and the Executive Budget\u2019s response \u2014 while not as aggressive as the Senate proposed \u2014 moves in the right direction.

The analysis notes that new capital investment in mental health facilities ($445 million) addresses critical infrastructure needs, including community residence expansion and the preservation of state-operated psychiatric centers.

## The Senate\u2019s Takeaway

The Blue Book\u2019s favorable analysis of the FY 2027 budget isn\u2019t uncritical \u2014 the Senate staff raises concerns in other sections. But on the core spending priorities of education, health care, higher education, and mental health, the message is clear: the Executive Budget invests in the services that matter most to New Yorkers, and the Senate Majority is prepared to build on that foundation during budget negotiations.$content$,

  'Blue Book Analysis: What the Senate Majority Staff Flagged as Concerns',
  'The Senate Majority''s Blue Book raises pointed questions about the Executive Budget''s long-term sustainability. The Department of Labor''s 54% funding drop, a 46.3% enterprise fund collapse, and $201 billion in Health Department reappropriations all warrant scrutiny.',
  $content$The Senate Majority\u2019s Blue Book isn\u2019t just a cheerful summary of the Governor\u2019s priorities. Its most valuable sections are the ones that flag concerns, raise questions, and identify areas where the Executive Budget\u2019s numbers don\u2019t add up. The FY 2027 Blue Book contains several pointed observations that deserve wider attention.

## The Department of Labor Cliff

The Blue Book identifies the Department of Labor\u2019s $8.3 billion funding drop \u2014 a 54% reduction \u2014 as the single most consequential change in the budget. While the Governor\u2019s office frames this as the planned expiration of pandemic-era federal unemployment insurance, the Senate staff asks the harder question: what happens to the services those dollars were supporting?

Federal enhanced unemployment benefits didn\u2019t just fund direct payments to individuals. They also supported workforce development programs, job training centers, and the administrative infrastructure that processes unemployment claims. As that funding disappears, the Blue Book notes that the Executive Budget does not propose state funding to backfill the gap. The implicit message: New York\u2019s workforce development capacity will shrink unless the Legislature acts.

## Enterprise Fund Spending Collapses

The Blue Book flags a 46.3% decline in enterprise fund spending \u2014 a category that includes self-supporting state programs like SUNY dormitories, state parks fees, and various revolving funds. This dramatic drop suggests that revenue-generating state operations are either being drawn down or restructured, but the Executive Budget provides limited explanation.

For the Senate, enterprise fund declines are a transparency issue. These funds operate somewhat independently of the general appropriations process, and large swings in their spending levels can indicate policy changes that haven\u2019t been publicly debated.

## Outsized Growth at Small Agencies

The Blue Book draws attention to several small agencies receiving disproportionately large percentage increases:

- **Council on Developmental Disabilities**: +55.9%
- **Deferred Compensation Board**: +39.0%
- **Commission on Quality of Care**: +28.3%

While the dollar amounts are modest in the context of a $318.8 billion budget, the Senate staff notes that large percentage increases at small agencies often signal policy shifts \u2014 new mandates, expanded programs, or staffing buildups \u2014 that deserve explanation. The Blue Book recommends that the Executive provide detailed justifications for any agency increase exceeding 20%.

## The $201 Billion Health Department Reappropriation

Perhaps the Blue Book\u2019s most striking finding is the $201 billion in Health Department reappropriations \u2014 spending authority carried forward from prior years that has never been drawn down. This single figure represents 64% of all reappropriations in the entire budget.

The Senate staff questions whether this level of deferred spending authority serves any legitimate fiscal purpose. Reappropriations for active multi-year projects are standard practice. But $201 billion in carried-forward health spending \u2014 in a department with $135.1 billion in new appropriations \u2014 suggests that enormous amounts of authorized spending have accumulated without review, without expiration, and without clear linkage to active programs.

The Blue Book recommends that the Senate Budget Committee conduct a detailed audit of Health Department reappropriations, with particular attention to how much is genuinely linked to multi-year contracts and how much is effectively dead authority that should be retired.

## Aid to Localities: The Quiet Squeeze

The Blue Book notes that Aid to Localities \u2014 the largest spending category at $239 billion \u2014 actually decreases 1.7% in the FY 2027 budget. While the education increase cushions the impact, other components of local aid face real pressure.

The Senate staff is particularly concerned about local assistance for counties and municipalities outside the education system. As federal pandemic relief has been exhausted and property tax cap constraints continue, local governments are increasingly dependent on state aid to maintain basic services. A declining Aid to Localities total, even with education carve-outs, sends a difficult signal to local officials planning their own budgets.

## The Senate\u2019s Role Going Forward

The Blue Book\u2019s critical sections serve an essential function: they define the Senate Majority\u2019s negotiating position heading into budget talks. By flagging the Labor cliff, the reappropriation overhang, and the Aid to Localities squeeze, the Senate staff is laying the groundwork for amendments that could reshape the final budget.

Whether those amendments materialize will depend on the three-way negotiations between the Governor, the Senate, and the Assembly. But the Blue Book ensures that the Senate enters those talks with a clear-eyed assessment of the Executive Budget\u2019s weaknesses \u2014 not just its strengths.$content$,

  'Where the Money Goes: Breaking Down $318.8 Billion Across 101 Agencies',
  'New York''s FY 2027 budget spans 101 agencies, but spending is remarkably concentrated. The Department of Health ($135.1B), Education ($49.7B), and SUNY ($13.4B) together account for over 62% of all appropriations.',
  $content$New York\u2019s FY 2027 Executive Budget spans 101 agencies, but the distribution of $318.8 billion in appropriations is anything but even. A handful of massive departments dominate the fiscal landscape, while dozens of smaller agencies operate on budgets that wouldn\u2019t cover a single large school district. Understanding where the money actually goes is essential to understanding what the state prioritizes \u2014 and what it doesn\u2019t.

## The Big Three: Health, Education, and SUNY

Three agencies account for over 62% of all state appropriations:

- **Department of Health**: $135.1 billion (42.4% of total)
- **State Education Department**: $49.7 billion (15.6%)
- **State University of New York**: $13.4 billion (4.2%)

The Department of Health\u2019s dominance reflects New York\u2019s Medicaid program, the largest in the country by both enrollment and spending. At $135.1 billion, Health is larger than the next four agencies combined. This isn\u2019t discretionary spending \u2014 it\u2019s the structural cost of the state\u2019s commitment to comprehensive health coverage for over 7 million residents.

Education\u2019s $49.7 billion includes Foundation Aid to school districts, BOCES support, special education mandates, and higher education assistance. SUNY\u2019s $13.4 billion covers operations and capital for 64 campuses serving nearly 400,000 students.

## The Middle Tier: $5 Billion to $15 Billion

Below the Big Three, a second tier of agencies handles the infrastructure of state government:

- **Department of Labor**: $7.0 billion (down from $15.3 billion \u2014 the pandemic cliff)
- **Mental Health**: $6.4 billion
- **Social Services**: $6.2 billion
- **CUNY**: $5.2 billion
- **Children and Family Services**: $4.7 billion (up 16.7%)
- **Transportation**: $4.5 billion (operating; capital is separate)

These six agencies combine for $34 billion, about 10.7% of the total. Each serves a distinct constituency, and changes in their funding levels ripple directly through communities \u2014 whether it\u2019s unemployment offices, mental health clinics, child protective services, or subway operations.

## Aid to Localities vs. State Operations

The budget\u2019s three spending categories reveal where the money ultimately lands:

- **Aid to Localities**: $239 billion (75.0%) \u2014 Money that flows to local governments, school districts, health care providers, and nonprofits
- **State Operations**: $69.1 billion (21.7%) \u2014 The cost of running state agencies, paying state employees, and maintaining state facilities
- **Debt Service**: $10.6 billion (3.3%) \u2014 Interest and principal on state bonds

The 75/22/3 split has been roughly stable for years, but the trend line matters. Aid to Localities declined 1.7% this year, while State Operations grew. Over time, this means a larger share of the budget stays in Albany and a smaller share reaches communities.

## The Small Agencies: Where Quiet Investments Happen

Below the headline agencies, the FY 2027 budget contains dozens of smaller allocations that rarely make the news but reflect real policy choices:

- **Agriculture and Markets**: $218 million (+$22M, +11.2%) \u2014 New investment in food safety, farm support, and agricultural development
- **Office of Mental Health**: $6.4 billion (+$344M, +5.7%) \u2014 Expanded community mental health services
- **Environmental Conservation**: $1.1 billion operating (+$67M) \u2014 Environmental enforcement and conservation programs
- **Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation**: $442 million \u2014 State park operations and maintenance
- **Office for the Aging**: $280 million \u2014 Senior services across the state

These agencies operate far from the spotlight, but their funding levels determine whether state parks stay open, food safety inspections happen, farms receive technical assistance, and elderly New Yorkers get the services they need.

## Concentration and Its Consequences

The top 5 agencies control 67% of all appropriations. The top 10 control 81%. This concentration is structurally inevitable \u2014 health care and education are expensive \u2014 but it creates a budgetary dynamic where changes to a single program (Medicaid rates, Foundation Aid formulas) can swing billions of dollars, while dozens of smaller agencies compete for attention at the margins.

For legislators, the challenge is ensuring that the 33% of the budget not consumed by the Big Five receives adequate scrutiny. A $22 million increase at Agriculture and Markets can transform food safety in New York. A $344 million increase at Mental Health can mean hundreds of new community treatment beds. These numbers are rounding errors relative to Health\u2019s $135.1 billion, but they\u2019re not rounding errors to the people they serve.

## Reading the Budget as a Statement of Values

Every budget is a statement of values expressed in dollars. New York\u2019s FY 2027 budget says, in effect: health care for 7 million people is our largest obligation; educating our children is our largest investment; and everything else \u2014 parks, farms, prisons, courts, environmental protection, economic development \u2014 shares the remaining third.

Whether that allocation reflects the right values is a question for voters and their representatives. But understanding the numbers is the first step toward answering it.$content$,

  'The Post-Pandemic Fiscal Cliff: What the Labor Department''s $8.3 Billion Cut Means',
  'The single largest line-item change in the FY 2027 budget is the Department of Labor''s $8.3 billion reduction \u2014 a 54% cut that accounts for nearly all of the budget''s overall decline. What does it mean for workers and the state''s workforce infrastructure?',
  $content$The single largest line-item change in the FY 2027 Executive Budget is a number most New Yorkers will never see: an $8.3 billion reduction at the Department of Labor, a 54% cut that accounts for virtually all of the budget\u2019s overall decline. Understanding what\u2019s behind this number \u2014 and what it means for workers, employers, and the state\u2019s workforce infrastructure \u2014 is essential to reading the FY 2027 budget honestly.

## What the $8.3 Billion Actually Was

During the pandemic, the federal government provided massive emergency funding for unemployment insurance through programs like Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC). These programs were administered by state labor departments but funded with federal dollars.

At peak, New York was processing over 1 million unemployment claims per week, and federal funding poured through the Department of Labor at rates the agency had never experienced. Those dollars flowed through the state budget as appropriations, inflating DOL\u2019s spending total to $15.3 billion in the prior year.

Now those programs have expired. The $8.3 billion drop represents the disappearance of that federal pipeline \u2014 not a policy decision by the Governor to cut workforce services.

## Why It Still Matters

The \u201Cit\u2019s just federal money expiring\u201D explanation is technically accurate but incomplete. Pandemic-era unemployment funding didn\u2019t just pay benefits to individuals. It also supported:

- **Staffing surges** at DOL to process unprecedented claim volumes
- **Technology upgrades** to the state\u2019s aging unemployment insurance IT systems
- **Workforce development programs** that helped displaced workers retrain for new careers
- **Fraud prevention systems** built to handle the scale of pandemic-era claims

As federal funding disappears, these capabilities don\u2019t automatically sustain themselves. The state must decide whether to backfill with its own dollars, scale back capacity, or accept that DOL\u2019s infrastructure will contract to pre-pandemic levels.

## The Executive Budget\u2019s Answer

The FY 2027 Executive Budget\u2019s implicit answer is: let it contract. DOL\u2019s $7.0 billion remaining budget is adequate for normal-year operations, the theory goes. The pandemic was an anomaly, and the agency should return to its baseline.

This may be a defensible position in the short term. Unemployment claims have returned to pre-pandemic levels, and the emergency programs served their purpose. But critics point out that the pandemic exposed deep weaknesses in New York\u2019s unemployment infrastructure \u2014 multi-week processing delays, a decades-old mainframe system, and overwhelmed call centers \u2014 that the federal funding surge was beginning to address.

Walking away from those investments means accepting that the next crisis will hit the same broken system.

## Workforce Development Gets Squeezed

The less visible casualty of DOL\u2019s funding cliff is workforce development. Federal pandemic dollars funded an expansion of job training, apprenticeship programs, and career transition services \u2014 programs that were already underfunded before COVID-19.

New York\u2019s labor market has changed significantly since 2020. Remote work has reshuffled commercial real estate and commuting patterns. Automation has accelerated in warehousing, food service, and retail. The skills gap between available workers and available jobs has widened in sectors like health care, construction, and technology.

Workforce development programs are the bridge between displaced workers and these emerging opportunities. Cutting their funding \u2014 even as a byproduct of federal expiration rather than active policy \u2014 weakens the bridge at precisely the moment it\u2019s needed most.

## What the Legislature Should Ask

The $8.3 billion reduction at DOL will likely pass through the budget process without significant debate. Federal expirations are treated as automatic \u2014 money that was never really the state\u2019s to begin with. But the Legislature should ask several pointed questions:

**What happens to DOL\u2019s IT modernization?** The state began upgrading its unemployment insurance processing system with federal funds. Is that project complete? If not, where does the remaining funding come from?

**What is the state\u2019s workforce development strategy?** With federal support gone, what is the Executive\u2019s plan for job training, apprenticeships, and career transition services? Is the $7.0 billion baseline adequate for a post-pandemic labor market?

**What is DOL\u2019s staffing plan?** How many positions created during the pandemic are being eliminated? Are experienced staff being retained or lost?

**What is the contingency if unemployment spikes?** If a recession hits in 2027 or 2028, does DOL have the capacity to process a surge in claims without federal emergency funding? Or will the state face the same system failures it experienced in 2020?

## The Broader Lesson

The DOL fiscal cliff illustrates a pattern that extends beyond any single agency: the federal government funds temporary expansions of state capacity, the funding expires, and states face a choice between backfilling costs or accepting diminished services. New York has seen this pattern with Medicaid, education, housing, and now workforce development.

The FY 2027 budget chooses not to backfill. That\u2019s a legitimate fiscal choice \u2014 the state can\u2019t permanently absorb every expired federal program. But it\u2019s a choice that should be made explicitly, with full transparency about what\u2019s being lost, rather than buried in a line item that most people will read as \u201Cthe pandemic is over.\u201D

  'Capital Budget Deep Dive: $19.9 Billion in New Investment Targets Roads, Environment, and Health',
  'The FY 2027 capital budget directs $19.9 billion in new appropriations across 63 agencies and 197 programs \u2014 a focused bet on infrastructure, environmental protection, and public health. Transportation commands the largest share at $7.4 billion (37%), followed by Environmental Conservation at $3.0 billion (15%) and Health at $1.4 billion (7%).',
  $content$Governor Hochul's FY 2027 Executive Budget proposes $19.9 billion in new capital appropriations spread across 63 state agencies and 197 distinct programs. This is the state's blueprint for physical investment \u2014 the roads, bridges, hospitals, university buildings, parks, and environmental systems that define New York's infrastructure for decades to come.

The numbers tell a clear story: Albany is concentrating its capital dollars where the physical need is greatest, while preserving flexibility to seed new programs at the margins.

## Transportation Leads with $7.4 Billion

The Department of Transportation commands the single largest share of the capital budget at $7.4 billion \u2014 37% of all new appropriations. Highway facilities alone account for $5.9 billion, reflecting the ongoing cost of maintaining and modernizing the state's 114,000-lane-mile highway system. Mass transportation and rail freight receive an additional $484 million.

This isn't discretionary spending. Federal highway formulas and match requirements drive much of the DOT capital program, and the state's bridges and roads face a well-documented maintenance backlog. The $7.4 billion allocation signals that Albany is meeting its federal obligations and keeping pace with deterioration \u2014 even if it falls short of the full modernization agenda that transportation advocates have called for.

## Environmental Protection Gets a Major Commitment

The Department of Environmental Conservation receives $3.0 billion in new capital \u2014 14.9% of the total and the second-largest agency allocation. This funds a portfolio that spans clean water infrastructure, hazardous waste remediation, environmental protection, and land conservation.

The financing mix tells an important sub-story: $1.4 billion flows through DEC-specific authority bonds, $425 million comes from the Environmental Protection Fund, $125 million targets the Hazardous Waste Remedial Fund, and $89 million supports the State Revolving Fund for water infrastructure. Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation adds another $589 million, bringing the broader environmental and conservation commitment above $3.5 billion.

## Health, Higher Education, and Corrections

The Department of Health receives $1.4 billion in new capital (7.1%), largely directed toward health care system improvement and facility preservation. SUNY follows at $1.2 billion (6.2%), funding campus infrastructure across the university system, including $100 million for residence hall rehabilitation.

Empire State Development \u2014 the state's economic development arm \u2014 receives $1.2 billion (5.9%), while the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision gets $603 million (3.0%) for facility upgrades across the state prison system. CUNY receives $421 million.

## Where the Money Flows by Purpose

Breaking down the $19.9 billion by state purpose reveals the priorities driving capital investment:

- **Highway Facilities**: $5.9 billion (29.7%)
- **Preservation of Facilities**: $3.9 billion (19.7%)
- **Environmental Protection**: $2.8 billion (14.2%)
- **Economic Development**: $1.4 billion (6.9%)
- **Infrastructure**: $1.1 billion (5.6%)
- **New Facilities**: $1.1 billion (5.3%)
- **Health Care System Improvement**: $1.0 billion (5.1%)
- **Health and Safety**: $868 million (4.4%)

Nearly half the capital budget \u2014 49.4% \u2014 goes to just two categories: highways and preserving existing state buildings. This is a maintenance-first budget, not a moonshot.

## How It's Financed

Authority bonds remain the dominant financing mechanism, with Capital Projects Fund authority bonds accounting for $6.3 billion (31.7%) of new appropriations. Federal capital funds contribute $4.4 billion (21.9%), underscoring how much of the state's capital program depends on Washington. The Dedicated Highway and Bridge Trust Fund provides $2.4 billion (12.0%), and the state's own Capital Projects Fund adds $1.7 billion (8.4%).

Smaller dedicated funds round out the picture: the Housing Program Fund ($859 million), Correctional Facilities Capital Improvement Fund ($603 million), Mental Hygiene Facilities Capital Improvement ($457 million), and the Environmental Protection Fund ($425 million).

## New Programs Signal Forward-Looking Investment

Two agencies appear in the capital budget for the first time with no prior-year reappropriations \u2014 a signal of genuinely new capital programs:

- **Alcoholic Beverage Control**: $17 million, likely funding modernization of licensing and enforcement systems
- **Inflation Reduction Act Elective Pay Program**: $10 million, positioning the state to capture federal clean energy tax credits through the IRA's elective pay provisions

These are small line items in a $19.9 billion budget, but they represent the kind of forward-looking capital investment that can catalyze larger returns \u2014 particularly the IRA program, which could unlock significant federal clean energy funding for state facilities.

## Concentration Is a Feature, Not a Bug

The top five agencies control 71.2% of new capital appropriations. The top ten control 85.3%. Critics might call this concentration, but in capital budgeting, it reflects a basic reality: infrastructure is expensive, and the state's biggest physical systems \u2014 highways, water treatment, university campuses, hospitals \u2014 require the biggest checks.

The FY 2027 capital budget won't satisfy everyone. Transit advocates will note the MTA's modest $75 million in new appropriations. Housing advocates will question whether $708 million moves the needle on the state's affordability crisis. But as a statement of physical priorities, the budget is coherent: maintain what we have, protect the environment, and keep the state's core systems \u2014 roads, schools, hospitals \u2014 functional for the next generation of New Yorkers.$content$,

  'The $126.9 Billion Question: New York’s Capital Reappropriation Backlog Demands Scrutiny',
  'For every dollar New York proposes in new capital spending, it carries forward $6.40 in unspent reappropriations from prior years \u2014 a staggering $126.9 billion backlog against just $19.9 billion in new appropriations. Only 13.5% is encumbered, meaning $109.7 billion sits as unused spending authority with no contract behind it.',
  $content$For every dollar New York proposes in new capital spending in FY 2027, it carries forward $6.40 in unspent reappropriations from prior years. That ratio \u2014 $126.9 billion in legacy spending authority against $19.9 billion in new appropriations \u2014 is the single most important number in the state's capital budget, and the one Albany least wants to talk about.

## What Reappropriations Actually Are

When the Legislature authorizes capital spending but the money isn't spent within the fiscal year, the unspent authority "reappropriates" \u2014 it rolls forward into the next budget as continued authorization to spend. In theory, this is routine bookkeeping for multi-year construction projects. In practice, New York's reappropriation balance has grown into something far more troubling: a $126.9 billion reservoir of spending promises the state has made but not kept.

To put that figure in perspective: the state's entire new capital budget is $19.9 billion. The reappropriation backlog is 6.4 times larger. It would take more than six years of new capital investment \u2014 at current levels, with zero new reappropriations \u2014 just to work through the existing queue.

## The Encumbrance Gap

Of the $126.9 billion in reappropriations, only $17.2 billion \u2014 13.5% \u2014 is encumbered, meaning there's an actual contract or legal commitment behind the spending authority. The remaining $109.7 billion is unencumbered: authorized on paper, with no contractor hired, no project underway, and no binding obligation to spend.

This encumbrance rate varies dramatically by agency. The Office of General Services has committed 31% of its reappropriations. Military and Naval Affairs: 32%. SUNY: 27%. But the Department of Health \u2014 carrying $7.3 billion in reappropriations \u2014 has encumbered only 9%. The Office of Mental Health, with $4.2 billion in legacy authority, shows just 6%.

These low encumbrance rates suggest that billions in capital authority exist as legislative artifacts rather than active construction programs.

## The Worst Ratios in the Budget

Some agencies carry reappropriation-to-new-appropriation ratios that strain credibility:

- **Metropolitan Transportation Authority**: $5.8 billion in reappropriations vs. $75 million in new funding \u2014 a **77:1 ratio**. The state has authorized nearly $6 billion in MTA capital spending over prior years that remains unspent, while adding a token $75 million this cycle.

- **State Education Department**: $2.5 billion in reappropriations vs. $194 million new \u2014 **12.8:1**. Capital projects for schools and libraries authorized years ago remain unfunded.

- **City University of New York**: $4.5 billion in reappropriations vs. $421 million new \u2014 **10.7:1**. CUNY's campus infrastructure needs have been acknowledged in budget after budget, yet the backlog grows.

- **Housing and Community Renewal**: $7.2 billion in reappropriations vs. $708 million new \u2014 **10.2:1**. In the middle of a housing affordability crisis, the state carries $7.2 billion in unspent housing capital authority.

- **Empire State Development**: $11.0 billion in reappropriations vs. $1.2 billion new \u2014 **9.3:1**. The state's economic development arm has accumulated $11 billion in capital authority it hasn't deployed.

- **Mental Health**: $4.2 billion in reappropriations vs. $445 million new \u2014 **9.5:1**. At a time when the state's mental health infrastructure is widely acknowledged as inadequate, billions in authorized capital improvements sit idle.

## Agencies Running on Autopilot

Perhaps more revealing are the agencies carrying large reappropriation balances with zero new capital investment \u2014 programs where the state has effectively stopped adding new money but continues to carry forward old authorizations:

- **Special Infrastructure Account**: $1.9 billion in reappropriations, $0 new
- **State and Municipal Facilities Program**: $1.6 billion in reappropriations, $0 new
- **Community Resiliency, Economic Sustainability and Technology**: $1.5 billion in reappropriations, $0 new
- **Sustainable Future Program**: $1.0 billion in reappropriations, $0 new
- **Jacob Javits Convention Center**: $350 million in reappropriations, $0 new

These are not small numbers. The Special Infrastructure Account alone carries nearly $1.9 billion in unspent authority \u2014 more than the entire new capital allocation for SUNY, CUNY, Housing, and Mental Health combined.

## The Transportation Backlog

Even the Department of Transportation \u2014 the budget's largest and arguably most credible capital program \u2014 carries a $35.7 billion reappropriation balance against $7.4 billion in new funding (4.8:1). Its 23% encumbrance rate means $27.4 billion in DOT capital authority has no contract behind it.

Environmental Conservation is similar: $20.4 billion in reappropriations, $3.0 billion new (6.9:1), with a 19% encumbrance rate. That's $16.5 billion in authorized environmental spending that exists only on paper.

## What This Means for Accountability

The capital reappropriation backlog creates three problems that the Legislature should take seriously:

**First, it inflates the state's apparent commitment to investment.** When the Governor announces a multi-billion-dollar capital program, the headline number includes reappropriations. But if 86.5% of carried-forward authority is unencumbered, the actual spending pipeline is a fraction of what's advertised.

**Second, it obscures prioritization.** With $126.9 billion in legacy authority spread across dozens of agencies, it becomes difficult to distinguish between active capital programs and zombie authorizations that will never result in construction. The budget process should force agencies to justify continued reappropriations, not rubber-stamp them.

**Third, it undermines fiscal transparency.** Capital spending authority that rolls forward indefinitely, without expiration or mandatory review, creates a phantom balance sheet. New York appears to have a $147 billion capital program ($19.9B new + $126.9B reappropriated). In reality, it has a $19.9 billion capital program and $126.9 billion in IOUs to itself.

## The Path Forward

The fix isn't complicated. Other states impose sunset provisions on capital reappropriations \u2014 typically three to five years \u2014 after which unencumbered authority expires and must be re-authorized. New York could adopt similar discipline without disrupting legitimate multi-year projects.

The Legislature could also require agencies to report encumbrance rates alongside reappropriation requests, giving lawmakers a clear signal of which programs are active and which are dormant. A capital authority with a 6% encumbrance rate after multiple fiscal years is not a construction program \u2014 it's a line item waiting to be cleaned up.

Until Albany addresses the reappropriation backlog, the state's capital budget will remain part investment plan and part fiction \u2014 a document that promises far more than it delivers, year after year, without consequence.$content$,
